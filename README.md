# milo-birthday-game
 A single level 2D platform game developed as a birthday message for my nephew. This was an experiment to see if I could use AI + "vibe-coding" to make a cool game prototype in under a week having never developed any video game before. In total it probably took 10-12 hrs with much of that time spent de-bugging. The next iteration should go much more quickly based on my learnings and key tips learned from others "vibe-coding".
